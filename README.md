# Developing for Oracle WebCenter Sites?

If you ever developed with Fatwire Content Server or Oracle WebCenter Sites, you may think (as many does) it is somewhat lacking friendly development tools.

As a developer you may have a wish list. I had a wish list too. At some point in time decided to fulfill some of my wishes for Fatwire and Sites development. This framework is the result of this (one year long!) effort.

If your wishes are similar to mine  you may be interested in this project. 

So, do you want...

## Use a __real__ [MVC pattern](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#MVC)  

thus separating presentation (view) from logic (control) and content (model) ?

## Avoid [unreadable JSPs](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#NoJSP) 

coding all your logic in plain Java (using full Java oop and not crippled JSP Java and awkward library CSElements) ?

## Keep the [HTML design](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#HTML) in his original form 

so it can be updated easily by Web Designer without extensive recoding?

## Code with a [simpler API](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#API)

possibly less verbose, more consistent and helpful in preventingsilly mistakes?

## Save yourself from [manual deployment](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#Deploy) with a build and an installer

avoiding manual css/javascript to copy, jars to deploy, templates to publish, tables to catalog move, properties to edit and so on?

## Use a real [version control system](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#VCS) 

thus tracking your work and sharing it with other developers in an healthy way?

## Write easily *real* [unit tests](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#UnitTest)?

so you can develop in Test Driven way and keep a test suite to avoid regression bugs?

## Run a [continous integration server](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#CI) ?

integrating and verifying the work of your team, allowing each developer to work in isolation with the JumpStartKit?

## Deploy your code as a [single jar](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#Jar) ?

that can be easily shared, tracked, compared and deployed?

##  Hot deploy your changes, [not having to restart](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#HotDeploy) the application server ?

when you do any change, even small, to your Java code?

## Use your [preferred IDE](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#IDE) and not CSExplorer or a mandatory Eclipse-only plugin

either Eclipse, Netbeans, Idea or even Notepad or VI if you like ?

## Keep your [existing work](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#Compatible) ?

while developing new code using this framework?

## Keep Oracle Support 

being 100% compliant to [standard practices](http://www.agilesites.org/about.html#Support) 

*If any of above is in your wish list*, then this framework may be suitable for you.
